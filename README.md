# Grade-12-Computer-Science-Course
Under this repository, all Java applications I made and reports I wrote for ICS4UR (Grade 12 Computer Science) course are organized under the separate units.  

## How to use this repository:
To access my projects, navigate through each unit. Each unit has a folder for each of the assignments as listed below. There, you will find Java applications, IEEE reports, and other documents. See the description of each assignment below and under the license header for each java file.  

## Unit 1: Basic Programming Concepts
1.1: Ethics Assignment - IEEE report discussing ethics regarding software piracy  
1.2: OOP Concepts - Simple document explaining the four main components of object oriented programming; Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation
1.3: Intro to Java - Simple Java GUI which displays my bio  
1.4: Variables, Data Types, Operators, Etc - SleepCalculator (Java Application that calculators number of hours user has slept in lifetime) and ChangeApp (Java Application that calculates the change to give someone in the lowest number of Canadian coins)  
1.5: Loop Structures and Selection Structures - Loop Structures (simple document highlighting what loops are) and RollerCoaster (Java Application that calculates if users are allowed to ride on a given roller coaster)  
1.6: Functions - Methods (Java Application that uses the Math library in Java to apply various math methods to different inputs)  

## Unit 2: Arrays
2.1: Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability - A technology autobiography (simple document that highlights impacts of technology in my life) and a report discussing impacts of technology on the environment (MLA Format).  
2.2: One Dimensional Arrays - SumElement (Java Application that takes input of only whole numbers, stores them in a list and outputs that list)  
2.3: Arrays in Game Programming - MatchingGame (Java Application that allows the user to guess which two cards are the same, continues until all cards are correctly matched).  
2.4: Two Dimensional Arrays - StudentGrades (Java Application that uses 2-dimensional arrays to store test marks, student names, and allows for calculation of student average and course average)  
2.5: TicTacToe Game - TicTac (Java Application that runs a Naruto-based Tic Tac Toe game on a 4 by 4 gameboard, run the TicTac.java file)  
2.6: Using ArrayLists - Employee (Java Application that uses object arrays (associative arrays) to store information about employees)  
2.7: Demonstrating Use of OOP Concepts - OOP (Java Application that allows user to input a car's brand and year and display some information about it using OOP concepts)  

## Unit 3: Advanced Programming Concepts
3.1: Exploring Computer Science - Quantum Computing (PowerPoint presentation explaining the emerging technology: Quantum Computing), Artificial Intelligence (PowerPoint presentation explaining theoretical research behind Artificial Intelligence), and Computer Science Collaborative Research (MLA Format report discussing collaboration between computer science and linguistics research).  
3.2: Recursion - Fibonacci (Java Application that uses recursion to find the number in the Fibonacci sequence at an input term), NChooseR (Java Application that  uses recursion to find the number of ways to choose a "r" different objects from a set of "n" objects), and ReduceFraction (Java Application that uses recursion to reduce an input fraction to the lowest terms).  
3.3: Searching Algorithms - BookList (Java Application that uses linear search and binary search to find books from a text file based on reference numbers).  
3.4: Sorting Routines - Sorting Routines (Java Application that sorts a random list of numbers (the size of which the user inputs) through different sort methods) and Sorting Efficiencies (Java Application that sorts a random list of numbers (the size of which the user inputs) through different sort methods and outputs efficiencies for each method).  
3.5: Accessing External Data - universitiesSample.xml (simple XML file that displays some university information) and XMLCreate (Java Application that creates an xml file, edits it, and prints out its contents using JDOM).  
3.6: Exploring Careers in Computer Science - Computer Scientists Career Research Report (IEEE Format report discussing the career path of a computer scientist).  

## Unit 4: Final Summative - Game
4.1: Scope Report - Scope Report for HomebaseDefence (simple PDF report discussing scope of the final summative).  
4.2: Feasibility Report - Feasibility Report for HomebaseDefence (simple PDF report discussing feasibility of the final summative).  
4.3: Code - HomebaseDefence-main (use run.sh for MacOS and run.bat for Windows to run the final game) and HomebaseDefenceUserGuide (simple user guide highlighting installation instructions, gameplay instructions, key features, and introducing the game).
